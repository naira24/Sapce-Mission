# 🚀 Space Missions Analysis 🛰️

This repository contains data and analysis related to all space missions from 1957 to August 2022. The project aims to explore historical trends, success rates, and key players in space exploration through data analysis.

## 📊 Data Overview

The primary dataset for this project is `space_missions.csv`. It includes comprehensive details on each space mission, such as:

-   **Launch Information:** Location, date, and result (success/failure) of the launch.
-   **Company Responsible:** The organization or agency behind the mission.
-   **Rocket Details:** Name, estimated price, and current status of the rocket used.

Additionally, a Power BI file (`space_mission.pbix`) is included, which likely contains interactive dashboards and visualizations built upon this dataset.

## 🎯 Recommended Analysis Questions

This project is designed to answer several intriguing questions about space exploration:

-   **Launch Trends:** How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased over the years?
-   **Country Performance:** Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has their dominance remained consistent over time?
-   **Rocket Usage:** Which specific rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is this rocket still active in current launches?
-   **Launch Location Patterns:** Are there any noticeable patterns or significant insights related to the various launch locations?
